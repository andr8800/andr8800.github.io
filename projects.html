                    1) At my first computer science related internship a few other interns and I designed and wrote A substantial amount of 
                    automated tests which focussed on testing the functionality of the companys website. Essentially we used a browser automation
                    software called Selenium which would execute the tests we wrote and alert us if there were any issues which we specified. Unfortunately
                    I no longer have the code to the tests, and even if I did i'm pretty sure I would not be allowed to share them but the company I worked 
                    for was<a href="https://www.consortiex.com/" class="external" target="_blank">
                    <span>ConsortiEX</span></a> which focussed on the logistics of delivering pharmaceutical drugs to hospitals and other end users.

                    2) One of the projects I did when I first transfered to St.Thomas was making a functional Rock Paper Scissors games
                    where a user would play against the computer. It was a relatively simple progam that just require understanding the logic
                    behind the potential outcomes of a rock paper scissors game. Below I show just a small part of my code.

                <div class="medium cell-auto" style="text-align: left;">
                    3) Another project I did was write a model of Conway's Game of Life. The point of the game was to simulate the state
                    of cells which abided by a set of rules to determine whether the cell lived or died. The game was set up in a tileset 
                    and filled in tiles represented a living cell. The game would then update and change cell positions based on the previous 
                    "turn".

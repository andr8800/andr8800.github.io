                    Some of my hobbys include golfing, reading, playing video games, hanging out with friends,
                    and spending time with my two dogs.

                    <div> With some of the free time I have I like to play various video games.

                        In the past some of the games I played were CSGO, Dota 2, Call of Duty, and more.

                        During the summer I spend a good amount of my time outside doing a variety of things
                        depending on where I am living at the time. If I am at my parents home in Wisconsin then 
                        I spend most of the time golfing, jetskiing, and playing with my dog Mika. If I am at my 
                        apartment in Minnesota then I will hang out with friends, my sister and her fiance, and Marvin.

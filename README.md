## About Me
This webpage is dedicated to introducing who I am and some of the things I enjoy doing. It was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript and uses the Foundation frameworks as the base of the webpages.

To get started, simply type [andr8800.github.io](https://andr8800.github.io) to view the homepage of my web page. From here, you can navigate between the other webpages via the menu at the top left or the links underneath my picture. 

## Resume
This page just displays some basic information on my resume. It was challenging to format this part how I wanted using HTML and CSS because I needed to learn how to properly wrap the specific parts of the writing that I wanted so it would be formatted correctly.

## Projects

This webpage just shows and talks about a few the projects I have worked on in the past including my first programming related internship, a simple rock paper scissors game, and Conway's Game of Life. 

## Other Interests

This page talks about my two dogs and some of the things I enjoy doing with my free time.
